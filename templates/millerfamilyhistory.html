    <p>My Grandmother, Marion Joanne Miller Eitemiller, took on this genealogy
    research project in earnest after her husband Bill (my Grandfather) died on New Years Eve 2016.</p>

    <p>Marion cherishes a lifetime of many memories: her own recollection of her grandparents,
    her parents and various aunts, uncles and cousins are vivid, occasionally mysterious and
    often entertaining.</p>
