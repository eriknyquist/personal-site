    <p>My Grandfather, Wade Nyquist, was captured by the German army in Tunisia
    in 1943, and remained a POW until 1945. He was eventually persuaded by my
    Grandmother to recount the whole story so she could write it down.
    <p>

    <p>At some point, my Grandmother typed up several copies of the original
    papers and passed them out to her kids. I found one of these copies
    at my Aunt's house, and scanned each page to have a digital copy for myself</p>

    <p>It's a fascinating piece of history, which you can download here.</p>
