    <p style="padding-top:20px">Tim Urban's original life calendars can be purchased
    <a target="_blank" href="https://store.waitbutwhy.com/products/life-calendar-24in-x-36in">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The idea behind Tim's life calendar is that each row in the grid is 52
    boxes representing a year of your life, and there are 90 rows. Essentially
    a giant rectangular grid of boxes that fits on a single large poster.</p>

    <p>The <i>problem</i> with this lovely idea is that it's quite difficult to
    actually find the box that corresponds to a specific date on this giant grid of
    blank boxes. Some annotation is required to make the calendar useful, and
    while there's plenty of space provided for this, it's a lot of work. So, when I
    discovered that I had essentially paid $20 for the opportunity to spend lots
    of time annotating a mostly blank poster, I had some ideas for extra
    features that make the calendar a bit more practical to use.</p>

	<p>Here, you can download a ready-to-print PDF of your own personalised,
    easy-to-navigate Life Calendar, in the same style as Tim's calendar but
    with some additional bells and whistles:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The box for the first week in each row is annotated with the date
         of that week's Monday</li>

        <li>Boxes for the week of your birthday are shaded</li>

        <li>Boxes for the week of the new year are shaded darker</li>
    </ul>

	<p>Unfortunately, you'll have to print it yourself; if I were to send you a
    printed one, I'd have to charge you money (because printing costs money),
    and then I'd be into the poster-selling business, which is a no-no. I even
    asked Tim about it (no, seriously):</p>
